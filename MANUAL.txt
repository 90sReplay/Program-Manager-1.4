This is a breif demonstration telling you how to Basically Use Program Manager, Theres no current Programs for this
(or they might just be very very un-popular) so dont expect it being the best at first.

On Start you'll see a PROGMAN window, This is the page you'll start at Every Time.

Now to See Program manager Help type "PROGMAN" and you'll get all the commands, and
typing "PROGVER" will show you the Program Manager version.

these 2 options are a menu
under the PROGMAN title bar that looks like this:

------------------------------------------
| {PROGHELP} {PROGVER}                   |
------------------------------------------

and the title bar looks like this:

------------------------------------------
| PROGMAN                           QUIT |
------------------------------------------

Title bar Notice: Sometimes depending on what your in,
"QUIT" wont be there. through out the manual it will state
if the "QUIT" isn't there but theres still a way to exit and the manual
will state that two.



Now on PROGHELP these are all the commands but more detailed:

PROGMAN----------------------Displays a Blank page like at start (Wish is the Starting Window)
PROGHELP---------------------Displays all of the Program Manager Commands that are available in your
                             Version (DASH commands wont show)
PROGVER----------------------Displays the current version of Program Manager installed on your PC that
                             Your using...
PROGDIR----------------------Brings up a window Showing the Directory of C:\PROGMAN (where Program Manager
                             is installed)
HOMELNK----------------------Shows a list of BATCH files that bring you to Programs, You can add them
                             Yourself or Program Installers will do it automaticly...
PANEL------------------------Displays all the Settings you can change on Program Manager
DOSHELP----------------------Shows you DOS commands you can run in Program Manager (We will talk about
                             This Latter...)


To Quit something type "QUIT", the "QUIT" on the top right of the window tells you
If the "QUIT" Will work...



In Panel (Type "PANEL" to goto it) you'll see 3 things to do
1. Quit
2. Smooth Theme (SMT)
3. SMT at Start (SMS)

now the (SMT) or (SMS) above what it is, means you type that to Do that action, now lets Explane SMT,
To make sure the Smooth theme works by Quiting Panel by typing "QUIT" and Type "NPGMGT" and if you see
a more Square and Smoother theme, the theme works properly. to go back to Panel just type "PANEL"
and if you want to enable that theme, Type "SMT" to enable it, you'll see the same theme as in "NPGMGT"
Type "QUIT" to leave PANEL and it should be the exact same but with the Smooth theme...

Now at Panel make sure your at the Normal Theme, Type "SMS" to enable The Smooth Theme at startup, but go into
Smooth theme mode and do "SMS" again to Make the Normal Theme to Show at startup (Wish is the Defualt)



On DOSHELP these are all the commands but more detailed:

DOSDIRC----------------------Displays the Root of the C:\ Drive
DOSDIRA----------------------Displays the Root of the A:\ Drive if you have a A:\ Drive
                             (There will be Messages if you dont have an A:\ Drive)
DOSVER-----------------------Displays the DOS version you have Installed on your Computer
DOSTIME----------------------Shows your Currently Set BIOS Time (Wish can also be displayed
                             in MS-DOS by typing "TIME" or "DATE")



When your at PROGMAN, PROGHELP, PROGVER, DOSHELP, DOSTIME, DOSDIRA, DOSDIRC, or PROGDIR by typing "QUIT"
you'll get a "Are you sure you want to shutdown your PC?" if you type "N" or "NO" it will cancel, but if
you type "Y" or "YES" it will display a message of its Prepairing to turn off your Computer, This message might
Instantly pass by, but when its safe to turn off your PC, it will say "Its now safe to turn off your PC..."

But if you type QUIT-D Instaid of Turning off your Computer, it will ask you if you want to quit to DOS, And
if you say Yes, you'll be Sent to a DOS Prompt.
